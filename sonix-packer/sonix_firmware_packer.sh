#   r1_original.upt            the stock firmware of the R1
#   sonix_player               the binary to install, the same one for both
#   sonix_launch               waits for the player and reboots when it exits
#                              (optional: without it the launcher's shell does)

# somebody who owns one of the two players can still run this and get theirs.
#
# One complete tree per model, and no shared layer: too much of what goes into
# an image belongs to the machine it is going into -- the touch driver is built
# against that kernel, the boot logos are drawn for that panel, and the audio
# pieces answer to that hardware. The files that really are the same in both,
# the language files and some of the images, are cheaper to copy than a rule
# about which layer wins.
#
# What that costs is the two trees drifting apart, so before each image this
# script lists the files the OTHER model has and this one does not. Usually
# that is deliberate; the once it is not, it says so.
#
# No questions asked: run it and it does the lot.
