// notices on the next tick of its timer, opens the next file, reopens the PCM
// and starts writing again. Drain, close, a timer tick and two opens sit
// between the last sample of one track and the first of the next -- a few
// tenths of a second on this device, which is a defect on a live album or a
// concept record where one track runs into the next.
//
// With it, the PCM is neither drained nor closed at the end of a track: it
// stays open with its queue still inside -- up to 750 ms of music already
// handed to the card, which keeps playing on its own. The next track opens
// while that queue drains and appends to the same queue, so the card is never
// left with nothing to play and there is no silence.
//
// The conditions for holding it are deliberately strict:
//
//   * the track must have ended on its own. After next, stop, or another
//     track, the previous queue is not wanted: snd_pcm_drop as usual.
//   * no DoP. A DSD stream has the DAC in a mode of its own, and appending PCM
//     to it is full-volume noise.
//   * the next track must have exactly the same format: channels, rate and
//     depth. An open PCM is configured on those three numbers and cannot be
//     reconfigured without closing it, which is the very thing being avoided.
//     A 44.1 kHz album plays gapless; the 96 kHz track after it reopens and
//     the gap returns, as it should.
//   * and the same output. Switching to Bluetooth midway is a different PCM.
//
// If the next track never comes, the thread waits a little over half a second
// (GAPLESS_HOLD_MS, less than the queue the card holds), then drains and
// closes as it would have done immediately. End of album therefore costs half
// a second of PCM held open, inaudibly.
