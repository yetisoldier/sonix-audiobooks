// The audiobook index: a small SQLite database of the books in the Audiobooks
// folder, separate from the music library (which ignores .m4b -- an audiobook
// in the middle of an album listing helps nobody).
//
// A book is one of two things:
//
//   a single file: an .m4b, an .mp3 carrying ID3v2 chapter marks, an .opus,
//   .ogg or .flac carrying Vorbis-comment chapter marks, or a loose audio
//   file whose album tag no other file of its folder shares;
//
//   a folder: two or more loose audio files of one folder with the same album
//   tag -- one file per chapter. They are the book's parts, in natural name
//   order, and the files of "CD 1", "Disc 2" subfolders count as the folder's
//   own. Files with no album tag are one book together.
//
// A row per book, keyed by its path: the file, the folder, or -- for one of
// several folder books in the same folder -- the folder and the album, a path
// no file has. Title, author
// and series come from the tags; where the tags say nothing, the folders the
// book sits in do, read as Audiobooks/Author/Series/... . Sorting uses the
// same collation as the music library, so leading articles are skipped ("The
// Hobbit" files under H).

// file cannot be opened, in which case everything below is a no-op.
