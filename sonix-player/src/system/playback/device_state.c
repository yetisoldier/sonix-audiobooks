// that end a session -- the power menu and the automatic shutdown -- do not go
// anywhere near the interface, so a position noticed only by a UI poll would
// never be written by either of them.
//
// When it writes:
//
//   the file changed, or the state did (play, pause, stop) -- at once;
//
//   the position moved by more than REMEMBER_MOVE_SECS since the last write.
//   Without this a seek made while PAUSED is never written at all: nothing
//   about the state has changed and the ten-second timer only runs while
//   playing;
//
//   every REMEMBER_PERIOD_MS while playing, so a flat battery loses that much
//   and no more;
//
//   once when playback stops, so a queue that runs to its end does not come
//   back up to ten seconds short of where it finished.

// restored. A track brought back at boot goes through a moment where the
// decoder has opened the file and the seek has not landed yet, and the engine
// reports 0; a poll in that window would write 0 over the very position being
// restored. The latch below holds every write until the engine reports the
