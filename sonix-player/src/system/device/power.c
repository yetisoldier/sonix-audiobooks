//   * CHG_CONFIG stops only what goes into the cell. The converter keeps
//     supplying the system from the cable, so the player always starts and
//     mp2731_hw_init resets the charger at every boot.

// the write. On resume it reuses nothing: the audio stream restarts from
// scratch (the CS43198's dai_shutdown/dai_prepare redo all the work).
//
// The same sequence is followed here, in the narrowest case:
//
//   * only with nothing playing (stopped or paused): no live music, no radio.
//     Pause is fine -- its PCM is already closed after 5 s and resuming reopens
//     everything from scratch. The only thing that crosses the suspend is RAM,
//     which is preserved.
//   * no live ALSA object: audio_suspend_freeze() also closes the PCM the
//     gapless path holds and waits for the audio thread to let go of everything.
//   * Wi-Fi parked first (an associated chip is 20-40 mA and the network would
//     die in the suspend anyway); with Bluetooth on it does not suspend at all,
//     because its resident daemons have no clean suspend path.
//   * not while a cable is in at all. What it is carrying is reason enough on
//     its own -- the card exported to a host, a computer feeding the DAC, an
//     ADB session -- and a cable that is only charging is reason too: the
//     charge limit is enforced by this file's tick, and the tick does not run
//     while the SoC is suspended.
//   * sync() first: the removable microSD loses power in the suspend
//     (keep_power_in_suspend=0 in the driver's script), so anything bound for it
//     must already have got there.
//
// The wake is the write() returning: the power key and PC28 are wake sources
// registered by the stock drivers. On return the clock and the idle markers are
// realigned, and the output path is forced to re-init so the resumed hardware
// is reprogrammed before the first PCM is opened.

//
//   - LVGL's input-read timer, every 30 ms. lv_indev_enable(false) makes the
//     callback return immediately, but the timer still fires, and every firing
//     is a full pass of lv_timer_handler() and a return trip through the main
//     loop. Thirty-three wake-ups a second to decide there is nothing to read.
//   - the status bar's clock, radio and battery timers, painting a bar nobody
//     can see;
//   - the player page's progress timer, moving a slider nobody can see;
//   - the screensaver's own clock, redrawing a screensaver that is already in
//     the framebuffer and is not being scanned out.
//
// None of them has any effect while the panel is off, because nothing is
// presented. So they are all paused at the blank and started again at the
// wake, where each is also made ready so it runs once immediately rather than
// showing a stale value for a whole period.
//
// A page registers its timer here once and then forgets about it; power.c
// never looks at what the timer does.
