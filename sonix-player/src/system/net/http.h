// A very small HTTP/1.1 client.
//
// http:// goes over a plain socket. https:// goes over the OpenSSL the device
// already ships, opened at run time -- see tls.h for why it is loaded that way
// and where the certificates come from. When OpenSSL or the certificate bundle
// is missing an https:// URL fails with a reason the user can act on, and
// everything http:// carries on working.
//
// A growing share of the stations in the radio directory are https-only.
//
// Two shapes of request:
//
//   http_get()         a whole small response into memory -- the API's JSON.
//   http_stream_open() headers read, body left on the socket -- a radio
//                      stream, which never ends and must not be buffered.
//
// Everything blocks, so nothing here may be called from the UI thread. Both
// calls take a timeout in seconds that bounds the connect and every read, so a
// server that accepts the connection and then says nothing cannot wedge the
// caller's thread forever -- which is exactly what a dead radio station does.

// What the server is told this client is. radio-browser.info asks for a
// descriptive agent of the form appname/version.

// followed, up to HTTP_MAX_REDIRECTS, and may cross between http and https in
// either direction -- which real redirects do constantly.

//                   is where an API says why it refused, which is what should

// successful DELETE answers 204 with no body.
//
// That last point is why a dedicated flag exists. Everywhere else in the player
// a 200 with no body is a failure -- a radio station that accepts the

// the decoder an empty buffer. But 204 is the right answer to removing a
