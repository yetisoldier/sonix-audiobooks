// with the title across the top and the format under it, over a blurred copy of
// the same artwork filling the screen.
//
// The setting lives in Music > Display options; these are how that page reads
// and writes it. The numbers are what goes in the config, so the first two keep
// the values they have always had.
//
// Which one is actually in force also depends on what is playing: see the note
// on layout_alternative in player.c. Waveform is for a file on the card; Studio
// takes whatever is playing, a station included.
//
// The names below are the ones the code has always used; the pills say
// Normale, Waveform and Alternativo. ALTERNATIVE is the one the pill calls
// Waveform, and STUDIO the one it calls Alternativo.
