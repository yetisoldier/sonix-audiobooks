## Supported audio formats



`.wav` `.flac` `.mp3` `.ogg` `.opus` `.m4a` `.m4b` `.mp4` `.aac` `.wv` `.wvc` `.ape` `.dsf` `.dff` `.aif` `.aiff` `.aifc` `.caf`

**CUE sheets** split a single ripped disc into up to 99 tracks, taking the format from the file the sheet points at. WAVs carrying their own RIFF markers work the same way.

**WAV and AIFF tags** are read from the ID3 chunk taggers add to them, so titles in any script and the cover come through; a WAV's own INFO list fills in whatever that leaves empty.

## Audio

- **Volume** - The same volume curve as the stock player is used.
- **Remember Volume** Four levels remembered separately, one per output: 3.5 mm, 4.4 mm, USB-C, Bluetooth.
- **Graphic EQ** - 10 bands at 31 Hz to 16 kHz, ±12 dB. Ten built-in presets and
  as many of your own as you like.
- **Parametric EQ** - 10 bands, each with frequency 20 Hz to 20 kHz, gain
  ±15 dB in tenths, Q from 0.10 to 10.00, and five shapes: peak, low shelf,
  high shelf, low-pass, high-pass. Preamp −15 to +6 dB. The page draws the real
  response, computed from the coefficients that are running. Presets are
  Equalizer APO files in the `PEQ` folder of the card: the `ParametricEQ.txt`
  that AutoEq publishes for your headphones loads as it is, and a preset saved
  on the player opens in APO.
- **MSEB** - HiBy's MageSound tuning, matched to the stock player: 10
  characteristics driven by 13 filters, with the slider travel selectable
  between 20, 40 and 100.
- **Soundfield** - mid/side width from mono to twice natural.
- **Channel balance** - ±20 dB in half-decibel steps.
- **Crossfeed** - level, cutoff and delay, all adjustable.
- **ReplayGain** - off, track or album, read from the tags.
- **Fade** - one to twelve seconds at the track boundary.
- **Gapless** - the PCM device stays open between tracks of the same shape.
- **DSD** - DoP by default, with nothing in the chain allowed to touch the
  samples; or converted here to 176.4 kHz PCM. DoP falls back to conversion by
  itself when the device refuses the rate.
- **DAC controls** - four digital filters, DRE, NOS, high gain, and DSD gain
  compensation from 0 to 6 dB.
- **Line out** - drives the jack at a fixed level for an amplifier, refuses
  volume changes while on, and puts your level back on the way out.
- **USB DAC** - the player becomes a USB sound card, 32 kHz to 384 kHz.
- **USB audio out** - a DAC or USB-C headphones driven with the player as host.
- **In-line remote** - the three-button cable remote: one click play/pause, two
  next, three previous.

## Library

- **Sorting across alphabets** - a collation that groups by script, folds case and accents, and skips leading articles unless you turn that off.
- **A–Z strip** - shown when scrolling a list.
- **Search** across tracks, albums and artists.
- **Albums with the same name stay apart** - an album is its name and whose it is: the album artist, the artist when there is none, and the folder when there is neither.
- **Quality badges** under a title: lossy, CD, Hi-Fi, DSD.
- **Playlists** - create, rename, reorder, delete. A long press on a row of All tracks, Albums, Artists or Album artists starts a selection, and the chosen tracks, albums or artists go into the queue, the favourites or a playlist together. Inside a playlist or the favourites the selection also takes the chosen tracks out, after asking. In the file browser the same works on tracks and folders, a folder bringing everything under it. A backup writes an extended M3U to the card that other players can read; import reads one back, resolves missing entries by file name, and reports what it found.
- **Playback modes** - normal, repeat all, repeat one, shuffle, and a continuous shuffle that deals a fresh order each round.
- **Album and folder chaining** - the next album starts when one ends, or the next folder in a depth-first walk when you came in through the browser.
- **The queue survives a reboot**, with positions, and so does the volume.

## Now playing

- Artwork edge to edge across the top, and the same picture flipped, blurred and dimmed behind the controls.
- **Alternative layout** - the progress bar becomes a **waveform**
- **Cover Flow** - an album carousel, swiped up from the bottom of the Music page.
- **Queue**, **Details** and, while an audiobook is loaded, **Chapters**.

## Streaming

- **Tidal** - sign in with the code on screen or with the QR-Code; Low, High, CD and Hi-res quality. Search, albums, artists, playlists, favourites and the featured lists. Favourites and playlists can be managed from the player.
- **Qobuz** - sign in with the account; MP3 320, FLAC 16/44.1, 24/96 and 24/192. Search, albums, artists, playlists, favourites and the featured lists. Favourites and playlists can be managed from the player.
- **Podcasts** - the Podcast Index catalogue: search, trending, follow up to 100
shows kept on the device.
- **Radio** - the radio-browser.info directory by language, country or genre,
plus search, favourites, recently played, and **My stations** read from a
`radio.txt` you write yourself in the card root. MP3 and AAC, HTTPS with real
certificate checking, and HLS.


## Wireless

- **Bluetooth out** - the whole stack is brought up by the player rather than by
  the firmware's scripts. Pair, connect, forget; the codec list comes from what
  the connected device announces and the best is chosen at each connection.
- **AirPods** - battery per earbud and for the case, model detection, and noise
  control: off, cancellation, transparency, adaptive.
- **Bluetooth in** - a phone or laptop connects and the player becomes its
  speaker, decoding through its own DAC. The incoming codec, rate and depth are
  shown.
- **AirPlay** - the player appears as an AirPlay target.
- **DLNA** - the player appears as a renderer.
- **Wi-Fi transfer** - a browser on the same network gets the card: upload
  files and whole folders, rename, move, delete, download, show hidden files.
  Reachable at `sonix-transfer.local`.
- **SonixLink** - a control protocol for a phone: the phone fetches the index
  once and queries it locally instead of paging over the wire. Playback state,
  queue, favourites, artwork and commands.
- **USB mass storage** - connect the device to a PC or a Smartphone to manage the files on the SD Card.

## Audiobooks

> Audiobooks go in the `Audiobooks` folder, in any subfolder: `Audiobooks/Author/Series/...` is read as the author and the series when the tags do not say.

- **Library, Series, Authors and Continue** - four sections, each sorted A-Z, Z-A or by date; the library also by recently listened, a series by the number of each book in it. Continue holds the books started and not finished, last listened first; the finished ones are behind the button beside the options.
- **A book is a file or a folder** - an `.m4b`, an `.mp3`, `.opus`, `.ogg` or `.flac` with chapters, or a single audio file is a book; audio files of one folder with the same album tag are one book whose files are its chapters, `CD 1` / `Disc 2` subfolders included, so several books side by side in a folder stay apart.
- **Author and series from the tags** - album artist or artist, `SERIES` / `SERIES-PART` and the movement name and number, in MP4, ID3v2 and Vorbis tags.
- The position is remembered per book, and survives a rescan.
- Chapters from the MP4 container, from ID3 frames, or from the `CHAPTERxxx` comments of Opus, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC.
- The two transport buttons are set independently to 10, 30 or 60 seconds.
- Speed 0.5x to 2.0x with the pitch preserved.
- Stop at the end of a chapter, and rewind a few seconds after a pause.
- **Sleep timer** - set a timer with the desired duration and the playback is paused automatically after it elapses.

## EPUB reader

> `.epub` files need to be inside the `Ebook` folder.

- Support for EPUB 2 and 3.
- Headings, emphasis, lists, quotes, rules, images, alignment and the table of
  contents.
- Text size from 14 to 50, line spacing, word spacing, margins, three reading themes (Paper,
  Sepia, Night) and three page-turn animations.
- **Bookmarks** - double-tap the top of a page; up to 64 per book.
- A **reading bar** along the bottom with chapter, page, progress, battery and
  clock, each one optional.

## Game Boy

> The `.gb` and `.gbc` ROMs need to be inside the `Games` folder, each in a separate folder: `GB` for Game Boy and `GBC` for Game Boy Color.
> The boot ROMS need to be inside the `Games/Bios` folder, dmg_boot.bin for Game Boy cgb_boot.bin for Game Boy Color. (This step is optional).

- Games show their real cartridge names, matched by CRC32 against the libretro
  databases.
- Save states, battery RAM, five palettes, shaders and GBC color
  correction.

## Settings

- **Appearance** - dark and light, six accent colors, clock position, a dynamic tint that borrows the accent's hue for backgrounds and cards, and a toggle to show/hide the battery percentage.
- **Screen** - brightness, screen-off timeout, double-tap to wake, screensaver,
  and 180° rotation with the touch rotated with it.
- **Screensaver** - choose to show the cover of the current playing track or pictures from the `Screensaver` folder.
  > Pictures need to be exactly 480x720 jpegs non progressive.

- **Power** - standby, LED behaviour, automatic power-off from thirty seconds to
  six hours, and battery charge controls. On the R1, the AXP2101 battery charge
  current is capped at 500 mA by default; this is independent of its optional
  approximate 80% voltage limit and does not change battery-percentage updates.
- **Date and time** - set by hand and written to the RTC, 24-hour clock, and a
  time zone with its own standard and daylight choice.
- **Language** - English, Italiano, Deutsch, Español, Français, Russian, Chinese,
  Japanese. Titles and tags in Korean, Thai and Arabic are shown too, Arabic
  right to left.
- **Remap buttons** - the three media buttons and the two volume buttons, each
  assignable to nothing, play/pause, previous, next, volume up or volume down.
- **Keyboard layout** - six layouts: English, Italian, German, Spanish, French
  and Russian.
- **Screenshots** - under More: volume up and the power key save the screen to
  the card.
- **System** - device, DAC, serial number, card space, OS version, firmware
  update from a `.upt` on the card, and factory reset.
- **Developer options** - unlocked by tapping the build number: ADB, log to the
  card, database log, disabling the software volume attenuation, and a page of
  running processes and memory.
